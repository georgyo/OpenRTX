# Factory for one Miosix-based firmware image, cross-compiled with the
# arm-miosix-eabi toolchain through the repository's own cross_<family>.txt.
#
# Notes on the build:
#   * All targets (Linux emulator included) are defined in every meson build
#     directory, so we never run a bare `ninja`; `meson compile` is given the
#     exact target names from targets.nix (which also resolves custom_target
#     names such as openrtx_gd77_wrap whose ninja name is the output file).
#   * find_program('radio_tool') is unconditional and required, so radio_tool
#     is on PATH for every configure.
#   * The cross files name the compilers by bare name; the toolchain is a
#     nativeBuildInput and is therefore on PATH. Nix's cc-wrapper flags
#     (NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE, hardening) only reach the wrapped host compiler.
#   * meson.build shells out to `git describe`; there is no .git in the
#     sandbox, so that line is replaced with the version the flake computed.
#   * Both -ffile-prefix-map entries keep the toolchain and source store paths
#     out of the image: libstdc++'s _GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS messages embed
#     __FILE__, which would otherwise change with every toolchain rebuild.
